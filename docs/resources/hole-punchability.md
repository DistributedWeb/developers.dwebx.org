title: Hole Punchability
---

:::note
**If your network is "not hole-punchable", you may have trouble connecting to other peers.** This may be due to your network configuration.
:::

dWeb's peer-to-peer networking relies on "hole-punching", a technique which makes your device accessible to people outside of your local network. 

In some cases, hole-punching may fail. This will be indicated by dBrowser in the top right.

This doesn't mean that **all** connections will fail, but it does mean that the odds of failed connections are much higher.

## Solving The Problem
Some network routers and VPNs do not support hole-punching. If you're using a VPN, try disabling it. You may also need to try other networks.

We're always working on new ways to ensure connectivity even if hole-punching fails. Sorry if this is a problem that you are continuously experiencing. We're working on it!
