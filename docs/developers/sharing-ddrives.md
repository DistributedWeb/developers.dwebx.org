Each dDrive has its own dWeb URL i.e. `dweb://<key>`. You can share this URL with anyone and as long as you are seeding the dDrive, it can be viewed by anyone who has a dWeb-enabled web browser.

You can copy the URL by clicking on the `Site Info` button on the left side of the address bar and selecting `Copy URL`.

You can see how many people are connected to a particular dDrive by looking at the peer count in the address bar.
