title: Your Home dDrive
---
dBrowser automatically creates what we call a `Home dDrive` or `Home Drive`, which is private by default. This dDrive is used for storing your private information, contains your saved dDrives, address book, bookmarks, terminal commands and more!

You can access your Home dDrive by selecting the hamburget menu at the top right, clicking `My Library` and then selecting `My Home dDrive`.

dBrowser assigns your Home dDrive the `dweb://system/` domain name. You cannot share content using the Home Drive, as each user has their own `dweb://system/` address. (This is a good thing because your Home Drive contains private information, like private keys!).
