title: Creating Files and Folders Within a dDrive
---
You can create files and folders within a dDrive either from the [editor](using-the-editor.md), the [terminal](using-the-terminal.md) or via the file explorer.

## Via the editor

1. Visit your dDrive and open the [builtin editor](using-the-editor.md). Then expand the files listing by clicking on the ellipsis icon.
2. Right-click in the files listing (but not on a file) and select "New file" or "New folder."
3. You will be prompted for the file or folder name. After choosing a name, the file/folder will appear in the listing.

## Via the files explorer
1. Visit your dDrive and open the files explorer by clicking `Explore files`.
2. Right-click in the files listing (but not on the file) and select `New file` or `New folder`.
3. You will be prompted for the file or folder name. After choosing a name, the file/folder will appear in the listing.

## Via the terminal
1. Visit your dDrive and open the terminal by clicking `Terminal` or by navigating to `dbrowser://webterm`.
2. You can create a directory by typing `mkdir` followed by the folder name.
3. You can create a file by typing `edit` followed by the filename. Using `edit` will open the editor where you can then write the content of the file.
