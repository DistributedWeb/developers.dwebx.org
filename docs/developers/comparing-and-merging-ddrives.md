title: Comparing and Merging dDrives
---

In some instances, it can be useful to copy files between dDrives. This may be particularly useful after [cloning a dDrive](cloning-ddrives.md) and making some changes.

## Via The Compare and Merge Interface
To open the `Compare and Merge` interface:

1. Navigate to your dDrive, click on the `Site Info`  button, go to the `Clones` submenu and click `Diff/Merge Original`.
2. This will open the compare interface
3. Choose the source dDrive on the top left and the target dDrive on the right using the dropdowns.

## Merging dDrives
Select the files you want to merge by clicking on the checkboxes in the left nav, and then click `Merge {n} Changes` to copy the files into the target.

You can review the differences by selecting individual files in the left nav.

The `Merge` will copy the files into the target dDrive, overwriting the selected files only.

## Other Users' dDrives
If you do not own the target dDrive, send the URL to the dDrive owner. It will provide them with the same inteface where they can review and merge the changes.
