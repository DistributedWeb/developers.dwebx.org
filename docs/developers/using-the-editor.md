dBrowser's builtin editor is a quick way to view and edit the source code associated with a dDrive.

## Opening The Editor
* Right-click on the page and select `Edit Source`, or 
* Press `Cmd+B (MacOS) or `Ctrl+B` (Windows/Linux).

## Saving Files
To save files that you're working on, press the "Save" button or press `Cmd+S` (MacOS) or `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) while the editor is focused (while the cursor is live within the editor). The page will automatically refresh with your updates.

## Navigating Within A dDrive
To view a files listing for a dDrive that you are currently viewing, click on the "ellipsis" icon in the top left.
