title: Creating New dDrives
---

There is no limit to the amount of dDrives that you can create and each one has its own URL. Each URL is referred to as a "dWeb URL" and always starts with `dweb://`. You can [share a dWeb URL](sharing-ddrives.md) so that anyone with a dWeb-enabled web browser can visit it.

Only the creator of a dDrive can change the files within it, which means that visitors to a dDrive can only few it. Although, it is important to note that they can [clone a dDrive](cloning-ddrives.md), so that they can make their own editable copy, which can be published as their own on the dWeb.

## Creating A dDrive
To create a dDrive:

1. Click on the hamburger menu on the top right of the browser.
2. Then select "New dDrive..."
3. You will be prompted to input a title and optionally a description, which are used to identify the dDrive on your local machine.
4. You will be taken to your new dDrive which will be mostly empty.
5. Your dDrive is now ready to edit. You can create a new `index.md` (for Markdown) or `index.html` (for HTML) by clicking on the links below the directory listing.
6. Lastly, you can use dBrowser's [built-in editor](using-the-editor.md) to develop whatever you'd like within the dDrive.
