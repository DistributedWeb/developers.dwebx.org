title: Cloning dDrives
---

When you clone a dDrive, you're creating a copy which is ultimately attached to its parent drive. Cloning is useful during development flows, considering it creates a clone which tracks back to its origin. You can easily [compare and merge](comparing-and-merging-ddrives.md) with the original dDrive.

You may want to clone a dDrive when you want to:
1. Remix someone else's work,  or
2. Work a dDrive without publishing the changes immediately, or
3. Work on a dDrive with other people.

## Creating Clones
To clone a dDrive, click on the `Site Info` button on the left side of the address bar. Then click `Tools` and then `Clone dDrive`.

You will be prompted to choose a label for the `clone`. The label is used privately to help you differntiate from the original and other clones. Choose a label and then click `Create clone` to finalize the process.

:::note
You can make an independent copy of a dDrive (not attached to its parent) by simply going to the `Copy` tab.

## Managing Clones
When visiting a clone, you will see the clone label in the `Site Info` button of the address bar. To view all clones of a site, click on the `Site Info` button and click on the `Clones` submenu.

From the Site Info panel, you can see a list of available clones. You can navigate between them and the original, delete them, and create new clones. 

You can view the forks of a dDrive in `My dDrives` by clicking on the fork number in the listing.
