title : Writing And Compiling & Deploying Smart Contracts
---

### Writing Smart Contracts
You can write smart contracts using your favorite code editor. Currently, smart contracts must be written in C++. To learn how to write ARISEN-based smart contracts, you can view our [tutorial](/backend/creating-a-smart-contract) later in this guide.

### Compiling & Deploying Smart Contracts
In order to compile and deploy smart contracts, you must use the ARISEN Contract Development Toolkit (CDT). You can learn how to install ARISEN CDT via its official repo, [here](https://github.com/arisenio/arisen.cdt) and can learn how to compile and deploy contracts on ARISEN via the following links:
