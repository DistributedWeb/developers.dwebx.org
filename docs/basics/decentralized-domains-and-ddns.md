title : Decentralized Domains And dDNS
---

Domain names on the dWeb are powered via a smart contract on the ARISEN blockchain and have no central authority. dWeb's domain name system works just as you would expect, only dWeb network addresses are used in place of IP addresses, and the dWeb introduces new record classes and types. A domain's records can be stored on ARISEN via the `ddns` contract's on-chain database, or within a dDrive (referred to as a "NameDrive", since it is the alternative to a Nameserver).

You can learn more about registering domain names, registering NameDrives and adding domains and records to a NameDrive via the following links:
- [Registering A Domain](/ddns/registering-a-domain)
- [Registering A NameDrive](/ddns/registering-a-namedrive)
