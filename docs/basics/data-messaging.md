Aside from web, mobile and desktop applications, the dWeb has other use-cases, considering the fact that its entire foundation is built around the peer-to-peer exchange of binary data feeds. This allows the dWeb's protocol suite to be used to decentralize  various forms of communication, in addition to media streaming services. A handful of developers are already at work creating the decentralized voice and video networks of the future using these same protocols. In other words, the sky is the limit. Let your imagination get to work!
